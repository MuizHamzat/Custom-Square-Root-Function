# Custom Square Root Function

This was an assignment from my MECHTRON2MP3 course.

 The purpose of this assignment was to create a square root function programmed in C without using the ```math.h``` library. I achieved this using the binary search method.

This function takes the number you want to find the square root of and the number of decimal places you want in your answer as parameters. The parameters can be changed at the bottom of the sqrtUser.c script, and the code can then be compiled and ran. To compile it, type ```gcc sqrtUser.c``` in the terminal, then run the executeable.
